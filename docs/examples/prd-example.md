## 1. Introduction / Overview

*   **Product/Feature Summary:**
    *   NaviGo is a mobile navigation application designed to provide drivers with real-time, community-powered traffic information and turn-by-turn navigation to help them save time and avoid road hazards.
*   **Problem Statement:**
    *   Daily commuters and drivers frequently experience delays due to unexpected traffic congestion, road accidents, and other hazards. Existing navigation solutions may not always have the most up-to-the-minute information, leading to frustration, wasted time, and increased fuel consumption.
*   **Vision:**
    *   To create the most efficient and informed driving experience by leveraging a community of active users who share real-time road conditions, making every journey smoother and safer for everyone.

    *   **Metric 2:** Average number of user reports per DAU.
    *   **Metric 3:** Route completion rate.
    *   **Metric 4:** Accuracy of ETA (variance between predicted and actual arrival time).
    *   **Metric 5:** App Store ratings and reviews (Target >4.0 stars).
    *   **Metric 6:** User retention rate (Day 1, Day 7, Day 30).

## 9. Assumptions, Constraints, and Risks

*   **Assumptions:**
    *   Users are willing to share anonymized location data to power real-time traffic.
    *   A sufficient number of users in the launch region will actively report incidents to make the community data valuable.
    *   Smartphone GPS accuracy is sufficient for core navigation and reporting.
*   **Constraints:**
    *   MVP development budget: [Specify Amount]
    *   MVP development timeline: 6 months from project start.
    *   Team size: [Specify, e.g., 2 mobile devs, 1 backend dev, 0.5 QA, 0.5 Design]
    *   Cost of map data and geocoding API services.
*   **Risks & Mitigation:**
    *   **Risk 1:** Low user adoption / insufficient critical mass for community data.
        *   **Mitigation:** Focused marketing in launch region, gamification/incentives for reporting (post-MVP), ensure core navigation is excellent even with limited community data initially.
    *   **Risk 2:** Inaccurate user reports or malicious reporting.
        *   **Mitigation (MVP):** Short expiry for reports, simple report confirmation (e.g., how many others found it helpful - post-MVP). (Post-MVP: Implement algorithms to weigh report credibility, user reputation system).
    *   **Risk 3:** High battery consumption due to continuous GPS use.
        *   **Mitigation:** Optimize GPS usage, provide user settings for location accuracy/battery trade-off (post-MVP).
    *   **Risk 4:** Scalability issues with backend services as user base grows.
        *   **Mitigation:** Design for scalability from the start, load testing, use cloud-based infrastructure that can scale.
