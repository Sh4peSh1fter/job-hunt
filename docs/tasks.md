## üìù Implementation Plan / Notes

### Initial Development Focus

-   **Strategy:** Prioritize setting up the foundational structures for both backend and frontend. Then, implement the first tool (Keyword Frequency Analyzer) end-to-end to establish a pattern for subsequent tools.
-   **Key Components:** FastAPI application, Next.js application, SQLite database, core tool logic modules.
-   **Open Questions/Risks:** 
    -   Complexity of Google Sheets integration and authentication flow.
    -   Ensuring the local-first approach is maintained even with optional cloud features.
