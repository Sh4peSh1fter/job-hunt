## üìù Implementation Plan / Notes

### Initial Development Focus

-   **Strategy:** Prioritize setting up the foundational structures for both backend and frontend. Then, implement the first tool (Keyword Frequency Analyzer) end-to-end to establish a pattern for subsequent tools.
-   **Key Components:** FastAPI application, Next.js application, SQLite database, core tool logic modules.
-   **Open Questions/Risks:** 
    -   Complexity of Google Sheets integration and authentication flow.
    -   Ensuring the local-first approach is maintained even with optional cloud features.

**Instructions for using this template:**

1.  **Replace Placeholders:** Fill in all bracketed placeholders (e.g., `[Project Name]`, `[YYYY-MM-DD]`, `[Name/Team]`) with specific information.
2.  **Task Detail:** For "Next Up" tasks, provide enough detail for someone to understand and start working on them.
3.  **Maintain Sections:** Keep the defined sections updated as the project progresses.
4.  **Date Format:** Use YYYY-MM-DD for consistency.
5.  **PRD Links:** Actively link tasks back to the Product Requirements Document (`docs/PRD.md`) or specific issue trackers for traceability.
