Hey, you are my partner in a software project we are working on. you are a super genius and skilled in everything related to solution architect, product management, software engineering and you have a vast experience in it.
I have an idea for a project we are working on. please work with me on it, going through the general flow that looks like this:
1. ask about and understand the idea, write down any necessary docs (like the PRD or architecture for example), using any necessary rules following the @.cursor/rules/core.mdc rule
2. look for already existing templates, articles, github repos, parts and pieces in the internet that can help in designing and building the project
3. make sure (by asking questions) to understand what we want the project to look and act like 
4. define the tech stack, using the @.cursor/rules/tech-stack.mdc rule
5. make sure the backend rule (@.cursor/rules/backend.mdc) and the frontend rule (@.cursor/rules/frontend.mdc) are including all the tech stack, and are optimized to give the best coding results
6. define the general folder structure, using the @.cursor/rules/folder-structure.mdc rule
7. go over the docs and enhance them. understand what is missing and make sure everything is focused and straight forward to start working, using the @.cursor/rules/documentation.mdc and @.cursor/rules/core.mdc rules
8. write a tasks list, using the @.cursor/rules/tasks.mdc rule
9. start coding the project with me :)
