## 2. Core Next.js and React Principles

# Next.js Best Practices

This document outlines best practices for developing Next.js applications, focusing on code organization, performance optimization, security, testing strategies, and common pitfalls to avoid. Adhering to these guidelines will help you build robust, scalable, and maintainable applications.

## 3. Code Organization and Structure

### Directory Structure

For the "job-hunt" project, we are using the Next.js 13+ App Router. The definitive structure is in `docs/folder-structure.md`. Key frontend aspects:

```plaintext
frontend/
├── app/                  # Next.js 13+ App Router structure
│   ├── (pages)/          # Main page routes (grouping without affecting URL)
│   │   ├── layout.tsx    # Root layout for all pages
│   │   ├── page.tsx      # Homepage content
│   │   ├── guide/        # Guide page route
│   │   │   └── page.tsx  # Content for the guide page
│   │   └── tools/        # Tools section route
│   │       ├── page.tsx  # Tools listing/launcher page
│   │       └── [toolSlug]/ # Dynamic route for individual tool UIs
│   │           └── page.tsx
│   ├── layout.tsx        # Root layout (can also be here if not in a group)
│   └── globals.css       # Global styles
├── components/           # Reusable React components
│   ├── ui/               # Generic UI elements from Shadcn/UI
│   └── specific/         # Components specific to job-hunt features/tools
├── lib/                  # Utility functions, constants, API interaction logic
├── public/               # Static assets (images, fonts, etc.)
├── styles/               # Additional global styles (if needed beyond globals.css)
├── tests/                # Frontend tests (Jest & React Testing Library)
├── next.config.js        # Next.js configuration
├── postcss.config.js     # PostCSS configuration (for Tailwind CSS)
├── tailwind.config.js    # Tailwind CSS configuration
└── package.json          # Frontend dependencies and scripts
```

*   **`frontend/app/(pages)/`**: This structure uses route groups `(pages)` to organize main page routes without affecting the URL paths. Each route (homepage, guide, tools) has its `page.tsx`. Individual tools will have dynamic routes like `tools/[toolSlug]/page.tsx`.
*   **`frontend/components/ui/`**: This directory is designated for UI components based on **Shadcn/UI**. You would typically initialize Shadcn/UI and then add components here using its CLI (e.g., `npx shadcn-ui@latest add button`).
*   **`frontend/components/specific/`**: For custom components built specifically for "job-hunt" features, which might compose elements from `components/ui/`.

**Recommendation:** Strongly adhere to the `app/` directory structure. Leverage Server Components by default and use Client Components (`'use client'`) only where interactivity is necessary.

### File Naming Conventions

*   **Components:** `ComponentName.jsx` or `ComponentName.tsx`
*   **Pages:** `page.js`, `page.jsx`, `page.ts`, `page.tsx` (within the `app` or `pages` directory)
*   **Layouts:** `layout.js`, `layout.jsx`, `layout.ts`, `layout.tsx` (within the `app` directory)
*   **API Routes:** `route.js`, `route.ts` (within the `app/api` directory or `pages/api` directory)
*   **Hooks:** `useHookName.js` or `useHookName.ts`
*   **Styles:** `ComponentName.module.css` or `ComponentName.module.scss`
*   **Types:** `types.ts` or `interfaces.ts`

### Module Organization

*   **Co-location:** Keep related components, styles, and tests in the same directory.
*   **Feature-based modules:** Group files by feature rather than type (e.g., `components/user-profile/`, not `components/button`, `components/form`).
*   **Avoid deeply nested directories:** Keep the directory structure relatively flat to improve navigation.

### Component Architecture

*   **Presentational vs. Container Components:** Separate components that handle data fetching and state management (container components) from those that only render UI (presentational components).
*   **Atomic Design:** Organize components into atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages for better reusability and maintainability.
*   **Composition over inheritance:** Favor composition to create flexible and reusable components.
*   **Server Components (app directory):**  Use server components by default for improved performance.  Only use client components when interactivity (event handlers, useState, useEffect) is required.

### Code Splitting

*   **Dynamic imports:** Use `next/dynamic` to load components only when they are needed, improving initial load time.  Example: `dynamic(() => import('../components/MyComponent'))`.
*   **Route-level code splitting:** Next.js automatically splits code based on routes, so each page only loads the necessary JavaScript.
*   **Granular code splitting:** Break down large components into smaller chunks that can be loaded independently.

## 4. Common Patterns and Anti-patterns

### Design Patterns

*   **Higher-Order Components (HOCs):** Reusable component logic.
*   **Render Props:** Sharing code between React components using a prop whose value is a function.
*   **Hooks:** Extracting stateful logic into reusable functions.
*   **Context API:** Managing global state.
*   **Compound Components:** Combining multiple components that work together implicitly.

### Recommended Approaches

*   **Data fetching:** For client-side components interacting with the FastAPI backend, use `fetch` or a library like `SWR` or `React Query` (if complex caching/refetching is needed) within Client Components. Server Components can fetch data directly if applicable (e.g., for static parts of tools or the guide page if sourced from backend).
*   **Styling:** Primarily use **Tailwind CSS**. UI building blocks should come from **Shadcn/UI** (which uses Tailwind CSS) and be placed in `frontend/components/ui/`. Customize these and create specific components in `frontend/components/specific/`.
*   **State Management:** Start with React Context for simple global state. For more complex needs, consider `Zustand` or `Jotai` due to their simplicity and good fit with Next.js.
*   **Form Handling:** Use `react-hook-form` for managing forms and validation.
*   **API Routes:** Use Next.js API routes for serverless functions.

### Anti-patterns and Code Smells

*   **Over-fetching data:** Only fetch the data that is needed by the component.
*   **Blocking the main thread:** Avoid long-running synchronous operations in the main thread.
*   **Mutating state directly:** Always use `setState` or hooks to update state.
*   **Not memoizing components:** Use `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
*   **Using `useEffect` without a dependency array:** Ensure the dependency array is complete to prevent unexpected behavior.
*   **Writing server side code in client components:** Can expose secrets or cause unexpected behavior.

### State Management

*   **Local State:** Use `useState` for component-specific state.
*   **Context API:** Use `useContext` for application-wide state that doesn't change often.
*   **Third-party libraries:** Use `Zustand`, `Jotai`, or `Recoil` for more complex state management needs. These are simpler and more performant alternatives to Redux for many Next.js use cases.

### Error Handling

*   **`try...catch`:** Use `try...catch` blocks for handling errors in asynchronous operations.
*   **Error Boundary Components:** Create reusable error boundary components to catch errors in child components. Implement `getDerivedStateFromError` or `componentDidCatch` lifecycle methods.
*   **Centralized error logging:** Log errors to a central service like Sentry or Bugsnag.
*   **Custom Error Pages:** Use `_error.js` or `_error.tsx` to create custom error pages.
*   **Route-level error handling (app directory):** Use `error.tsx` within route segments to handle errors specific to that route.

## 5. Performance Considerations

### Optimization Techniques

*   **Image optimization:** Use `next/image` component for automatic image optimization, including lazy loading and responsive images.
*   **Font optimization:**  Use `next/font` to optimize font loading and prevent layout shift.
*   **Code splitting:** Use dynamic imports and route-level code splitting to reduce initial load time.
*   **Caching:** Use caching strategies (e.g., `Cache-Control` headers, `SWR`, `React Query`) to reduce data fetching overhead.
*   **Memoization:** Use `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders of components.
*   **Prefetching:** Use the `<Link prefetch>` tag to prefetch pages that are likely to be visited.
*   **SSR/SSG:** Use Static Site Generation (SSG) for content that doesn't change often and Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for dynamic content.
*   **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR):** Use ISR to update statically generated pages on a regular interval.

### Memory Management

*   **Avoid memory leaks:** Clean up event listeners and timers in `useEffect` hooks.
*   **Minimize re-renders:** Only update state when necessary to reduce the number of re-renders.
*   **Use immutable data structures:** Avoid mutating data directly to prevent unexpected side effects.

### Rendering Optimization

*   **Server Components (app directory):**  Render as much as possible on the server to reduce client-side JavaScript.
*   **Client Components (app directory):** Only use client components when interactivity is required. Defer rendering of non-critical client components using `React.lazy`.

### Bundle Size Optimization

*   **Analyze bundle size:** Use tools like `webpack-bundle-analyzer` to identify large dependencies.
*   **Remove unused code:** Use tree shaking to remove unused code from your bundles.
*   **Use smaller dependencies:** Replace large dependencies with smaller, more lightweight alternatives.
*   **Compression:** Enable Gzip or Brotli compression on your server to reduce the size of the transferred files.

### Lazy Loading

*   **Images:** Use `next/image` for automatic lazy loading of images.
*   **Components:** Use `next/dynamic` for lazy loading of components.
*   **Intersection Observer:** Use the Intersection Observer API for manual lazy loading of content.

## 6. Security Best Practices

### Common Vulnerabilities

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Sanitize user input to prevent XSS attacks.  Be especially careful when rendering HTML directly from user input.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Use CSRF tokens to protect against CSRF attacks.
*   **SQL Injection:** Use parameterized queries or an ORM to prevent SQL injection attacks.
*   **Authentication and Authorization vulnerabilities:** Implement secure authentication and authorization mechanisms.  Avoid storing secrets in client-side code.
*   **Exposing sensitive data:** Protect API keys and other sensitive data by storing them in environment variables and accessing them on the server-side.

### Input Validation

*   **Server-side validation:** Always validate user input on the server-side.
*   **Client-side validation:** Use client-side validation for immediate feedback, but don't rely on it for security.
*   **Sanitize input:** Sanitize user input to remove potentially malicious code.
*   **Use a validation library:** Use a library like `zod` or `yup` for validating user input.

### Authentication and Authorization

*   **Use a secure authentication provider:** Use a service like Auth0, NextAuth.js, or Firebase Authentication for secure authentication.
*   **Store tokens securely:** Store tokens in HTTP-only cookies or local storage.
*   **Implement role-based access control:** Use role-based access control to restrict access to sensitive resources.
*   **Protect API endpoints:** Use authentication middleware to protect API endpoints.

### Data Protection

*   **Encrypt sensitive data:** Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
*   **Use HTTPS:** Use HTTPS to encrypt communication between the client and the server.
*   **Regularly update dependencies:** Keep your dependencies up to date to patch security vulnerabilities.
*   **Secure environment variables:**  Never commit environment variables to your repository.  Use a secrets management tool if necessary.

### Secure API Communication

*   **Use HTTPS:** Use HTTPS for all API communication.
*   **Authenticate API requests:** Use API keys or tokens to authenticate API requests.
*   **Rate limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of your API.
*   **Input validation:** Validate all API request parameters.
*   **Output encoding:** Properly encode API responses to prevent injection attacks.

## 7. Testing Approaches

### Unit Testing

*   **Frameworks:** Use **Jest** as the test runner and **React Testing Library** for rendering components and interacting with them from a user's perspective.
*   **Test individual components:** Write unit tests for components in `frontend/components/` to ensure they render correctly based on props and interact as expected.

### Integration Testing

*   **Test interactions between components:** Write integration tests to ensure that components are working together correctly.
*   **Test API calls:** Test API calls to ensure that data is being fetched and saved correctly.
*   **Use a testing framework:** Use a testing framework like Jest or Mocha with libraries like `msw` (Mock Service Worker) to intercept and mock API calls.

### End-to-End Testing

*   **Test the entire application:** Write end-to-end tests to ensure that the entire application is working correctly.
*   **Use a testing framework:** Use a testing framework like Cypress or Playwright.
*   **Test user flows:** Test common user flows to ensure that the application is providing a good user experience.
*   **Focus on critical paths:**  Prioritize end-to-end tests for critical user flows to ensure application stability.

### Test Organization

*   **Co-locate tests with components:** Keep tests in the same directory as the components they are testing.
*   **Use a consistent naming convention:** Use a consistent naming convention for test files (e.g., `ComponentName.test.js`).
*   **Organize tests by feature:** Organize tests by feature to improve maintainability.

### Mocking and Stubbing

*   **Mock external dependencies:** Mock external dependencies to isolate components during testing.
*   **Stub API calls:** Stub API calls to prevent network requests during testing.
*   **Use a mocking library:** Use a mocking library like Jest's built-in mocking capabilities or `msw`.

## 8. Common Pitfalls and Gotchas

### Frequent Mistakes

*   **Not understanding server-side rendering:**  Failing to utilize SSR effectively can impact SEO and initial load performance.
*   **Over-complicating state management:** Using Redux for simple state management needs can add unnecessary complexity.
*   **Not optimizing images:** Not using `next/image` can result in large image sizes and slow loading times.
*   **Ignoring security best practices:** Neglecting security can lead to vulnerabilities.
*   **Not testing the application thoroughly:** Insufficient testing can result in bugs and regressions.

*   **Automate deployments:** Automate deployments to reduce the risk of human error.

## 10. TailwindCSS Specific Guidelines

-   **Shadcn/UI Integration:** When using components from **Shadcn/UI**, remember that you are bringing the source code of these components into your `frontend/components/ui/` directory. This means you can directly customize their Tailwind classes and structure as needed. Follow Shadcn/UI documentation for adding and using components.
-   Use Tailwind's Configuration File (`tailwind.config.js`) to customize the theme (colors, spacing, fonts) to match the desired look and feel for "job-hunt", extending the defaults provided by Shadcn/UI if necessary.
-   Adopt a Mobile-First Approach: Design for smaller screens first and then use Tailwind's responsive modifiers (e.g., `md:`, `lg:`) to adapt the layout and styles for larger screens.  This improves the user experience on mobile devices and reduces the amount of CSS needed.
-   Utilize Tailwind UI or other component libraries built with Tailwind CSS to accelerate development and maintain a consistent design language.  Customize the components as needed to fit the specific requirements of the project.  Alternatively, create your own reusable components.
-   Optimize for Performance:  Be mindful of the number of Tailwind classes used on each element.  Consider using `@apply` in CSS or extracting common styles into custom CSS classes to reduce duplication and improve performance. Use `content` variants when needed instead of the `DEFAULT` to control when generated classes are added.  For instance, use `content-[url(..)]` instead of `content-[url(..)]`. Configure the JIT mode for faster build times during development.
-   Stay Organized with Components: Break down the UI into smaller, reusable components.  Use a consistent naming convention for components and Tailwind classes.  Consider using a component library like Storybook to document and showcase the components.
-   Integrate with a Design System: Define a clear design system with consistent colors, typography, and spacing.  Map the design system tokens to Tailwind's configuration file.  This ensures that the UI is consistent and aligned with the brand guidelines.
-   Use semantic class names: While Tailwind promotes utility-first CSS, consider using semantic class names in conjunction with Tailwind classes to improve readability and maintainability. For example, instead of `<button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">`, you could use `<button class="primary-button">` and define the corresponding styles in your CSS file using `@apply`. This allows you to update the button styles in one place without having to modify the HTML.
-   Create Custom Utilities: Extend Tailwind's functionality by creating custom utilities for frequently used CSS patterns. Add these utilities to `tailwind.config.js` under the `extend.utilities` section. This will allow you to apply these patterns with a single class name.
-   Use the Theme Function:  Leverage the `theme()` function in your CSS or JavaScript files to access values defined in `tailwind.config.js`. This ensures that you are using consistent values throughout your project and that changes to the theme are reflected everywhere.
-   Avoid Inline Styles: Refrain from using inline styles as much as possible. Tailwind provides a comprehensive set of utility classes, so most styling needs can be met without resorting to inline styles. Inline styles can make it harder to maintain and update the styles in your project.
-   Use Layer Directives: Use `@layer` directives in your CSS to organize your styles and ensure that Tailwind's base styles are applied correctly. This can help prevent conflicts between your custom styles and Tailwind's default styles.
-   Be Careful with Arbitrary Values: While Tailwind allows you to use arbitrary values with square bracket notation (e.g., `w-[23px]`), use this feature sparingly. Overuse of arbitrary values can make your code less readable and harder to maintain. Prefer using values defined in your `tailwind.config.js` file whenever possible.
-   Utilize Variants Effectively: Understand and use Tailwind's variants (e.g., `hover:`, `focus:`, `active:`) to create interactive and dynamic styles. Customize the variants in `tailwind.config.js` to match the specific needs of your project.
-   Code Organization and Structure:
    - Directory structure: Organize your Tailwind CSS files into a logical directory structure. Common approaches include:
        - `src/css/`: Contains `tailwind.css` (input file) and other custom CSS files.
        - `src/components/`: Contains reusable UI components.
        - `src/layout/`: Contains layout components (e.g., header, footer, navigation).
    - File naming conventions: Use descriptive and consistent file names. For example:
        - `button.css`: Styles for a button component.
        - `header.js`: JavaScript file for a header component.
    - Module organization: Break down your CSS into smaller, manageable modules. Use `@import` in your `tailwind.css` file to import these modules. This improves code organization and maintainability.
    - Component architecture: Design your UI with a component-based architecture. Each component should have its own CSS file that defines the styles for that component.
    - Code splitting strategies: Consider using code splitting to reduce the initial load time of your application. This can be achieved by splitting your CSS into smaller chunks and loading them on demand.
-   Common Patterns and Anti-patterns:
    - Design patterns: 
        - Atomic CSS: Tailwind promotes the atomic CSS approach, where styles are applied using small, single-purpose utility classes.
        - Utility-first CSS: Prioritize using utility classes over custom CSS classes.
        - Component-based styling: Encapsulate styles within components.
    - Recommended approaches: 
        - Use a consistent naming convention for your components and CSS classes.
        - Document your components and styles.
        - Test your components and styles.
    - Anti-patterns: 
        - Overusing custom CSS classes: Try to use Tailwind's utility classes as much as possible.
        - Hardcoding values: Use the theme configuration instead of hardcoding values.
        - Not using PurgeCSS: This can lead to a large CSS file in production.
    - State management: Use a state management library like Redux or Zustand to manage the state of your application. Apply tailwind classes based on state changes.
    - Error handling: Implement proper error handling to catch and handle errors gracefully.
-   Performance Considerations:
    - Optimization techniques: 
        - Use PurgeCSS to remove unused styles.
        - Enable JIT mode.
        - Optimize images.
    - Memory management: Be mindful of memory usage, especially when dealing with large datasets or complex UIs.
    - Rendering optimization: Use techniques like virtualization and memoization to optimize rendering performance.
    - Bundle size optimization: Reduce the size of your CSS and JavaScript bundles.
    - Lazy loading: Load resources on demand to improve initial load time.
-   Security Best Practices:
    - Common vulnerabilities: 
        - Cross-site scripting (XSS)
        - Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
        - Injection attacks
    - Input validation: Validate all user input to prevent malicious data from being injected into your application.
    - Authentication and authorization: Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect your application from unauthorized access.
    - Data protection: Protect sensitive data by encrypting it and storing it securely.
    - Secure API communication: Use HTTPS to encrypt communication between your application and the server.
-   Testing Approaches:
    - Unit testing: Test individual components and functions in isolation.
    - Integration testing: Test the interaction between different components and modules.
    - End-to-end testing: Test the entire application from start to finish.
    - Test organization: Organize your tests into a logical directory structure.
    - Mocking and stubbing: Use mocking and stubbing to isolate your tests and avoid dependencies on external resources.
